        <h2>The Birth Story of Coral Jean</h2>

        <p>I held a smile inside my cheek. It was a small smile, and secret. It was the smile of a woman who feels the world shifting, not outside, but within. I sat quietly through the first few
        contractions, feeling the rising excitement that swelled and ebbed in rhythm with my body. This was the moment we had been waiting for. Waiting more and more impatiently as my due date
        passed by and February loomed.</p>

        <p>It was February 1st, a Sunday night, and when I could no longer contain my excitement, I turned to Brian, my sister Sage, and Mama Suki, and told them, "It's started!"</p>

        <p>We slept that night until 4am, when the strengthening contractions would no longer let me rest. They grew stronger and closer together, so we called Jasmine, our midwife. But even as the sun rose, the contractions slowed and lessened. It seems that was just the practice run and we would have to wait a bit longer. The day passed slowly: resting, going on walks, and trying to eat and sleep. As the sun set, the intensity seemed to rise up, telling us the baby was ready to begin again.</p>

        <p>Jasmine joined us around 11pm that evening. She checked me and I was effaced, but only 1cm dilated. It was disappointing. The previous 24 hours were only a warm up. My work was just beginning.</p>

        <p>I labored all that night, catnapping between contractions, sitting on the birth stool and leaning against the bed. Jasmine, Brian and Mama Suki took turns sitting with me and sleeping on the couch. It was a long night.</p>

        <p>At 8am in the morning Jasmine checked me again and I was 3 cm dilated. I felt disheartened. I was very tired, and with almost 36 hours behind me of what felt like little progress, I saw my labor stretching out ahead of me indefinitely. The contractions continued to strengthen. At one point we set up the birth tub. It was wonderfully relaxing, but it slowed my labor, so Jasmine got me out and sent me on a walk with Brian.</p>

        <p>By noon I was exhausted. I wanted my baby to be born with every fiber of my being. I needed my baby to be born. So Brian and I talked to Jasmine, asking what we could do to get things moving. While she thought about that we went back to the bedroom. Brian was my rock. He looked me in the eye and had me repeating, "I'm going to have this baby. I'm going to have this baby now!" He coaxed me into a squat and held my hands as the next contraction roared through me. He coaxed me onto hands and knees and supported me when I could no longer support myself. And then my water broke. With that rush of water everything changed. Even as Jasmine came in to give us our options I felt the urge to push. With that feeling came a surge of energy and excitement.</p>

        <p>I got back into the birth tub, feeling buoyed and soothed by the hot water. Sage and Mama Suki took turns rubbing my shoulders and placing cool cloths on my forehead. The next two hours passed quickly. I could feel my baby moving down the birth canal. The top of its head moving closer and closer to my fingers, until it was there on the cusp and I was slowing down, holding back, breathing my baby gradually into the light, into the water. Lifting her body, so small, up out of the water and onto my chest.</p>

        <p>It was February 3rd, 3:08pm. She had a light fuzz of dark hair on her head and small pouty red lips. She was calm, she was breathing, and she was perfect. And though I had hardly slept in days, Brian and I stayed up to watch her and hold her; to watch her nurse, to watch her breath and sleep and dream.</p>

        <p>It was the most miraculous experience Brian and I had ever had. It bonded us together and to our baby girl in a way we're still unable to comprehend.</p>

        <p>Coral's birth was the crescendo in a song played out over the last nine months. And it was just the very, very beginning.</p>

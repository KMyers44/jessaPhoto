        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>How did you become interested in birth photography?</h2>

        <p>My mother had 3 home births and my father videoed all but the first. By the last birth my father was asking her to scootch around for a better shot while she was crowning (not recommended photographic etiquette, but that was my parents for you). She took video for remembrance but also for sharing the beauty and intensity of birth with other pregnant mamas.</p>

        <p>My interest in photography started in my high school darkroom and continued through a degree in photojournalism from Syracuse Universities Newhouse School of Communications. After college I freelanced for newspapers and photographed weddings and portraits, but I never felt like I found my niche.</p>

        <p>Then, I had my children and my focus shifted back to birth. I began teaching prenatal yoga and played with the idea of becoming a doula. Then one of my friends, who is a doula, asked me to photograph a birth with her. And I was like, "Wait! I can BE a Birth Photographer!? That's perfect!"</p>

        <p>It is very exciting for me to finally meld my passions for photography and birth in a way that serves women and families.</p>

        <h2>What is your past experience with photography during your own births?</h2>

        <p>Every year on my children's birthdays, we read their birth stories and look over the photos from their births together. It is a very special time for us. We did not have a photographer, and looking back I wonder why I didn't hire a photographer?! But I treasure the few images I do have. They are photographs that capture a powerful depth of emotion and connectedness. Follow the links to see <a href="coral.html">Coral's</a> and <a href="cruz.html">Cruz's</a> stories.</p>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>What is Birth Photography?</h2>

        <p>Your images will be truthful, artistic, emotional, story-telling images. The photographs can be as graphic as you wish. Crowning photographs are only captured upon request of the client.</p>
        <br>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>When should I book my birth photographer?</h2>

        <p>Sooner is better. Most photographers are only able to book 2 - 3 births each month to ensure that they are able to make every birth. Booking earlier also gives you a chance to get to know your birth photographer and ensure that you will be comfortable with the energy they bring into the room. But it is also never too late to call and check availability. Click <a href="contact.html">here</a> to get in touch.</p>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>In which areas of Boulder do you work?</h2>

        <p>I live in Longmont, but I am available in Boulder County and surrounding areas within a 1 hour drive.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>I live out of the Boulder area or state of CO. Will you attend out-of-area births?</h2>

        <p>I am open to attending births farther away but my ability to do so will depend on the unique situation. A travel fee may apply. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> to discuss your situation.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>I'm considering hiring you. What are the steps involved?</h2>

        <p> 1) We make an appointment for us to meet and get to know each other. You will have a chance to ask me any questions you still have and to share your birth plan with me.</p>

        <p> 2) If you decide you would like to book my photography services, I will provide you with a contract to look over and sign.</p>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>Do you offer maternity or newborn photography too?</h2>

        <p>My focus is on birth photography and storytelling. At this time I offer maternity and newborn photography only to my birth mamas.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>Do you provide labor support, sibling support, or other birth services?</h2>

        <p>No. I recommend that mama's use a Doula, or other qualified individual for labor support. If money is an issue and you are choosing between a Doula and a photographer, go with the Doula. I have a discounted photography and Doula package that I offer with a wonderful Doula and my dear friend <a href="http://www.doulaoftherockies.com" target="_blank">Melissa Inscore</a>.</p>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>Can't my husband/doula/nurse just take pictures?</h2>

        <p>Your husband and/or doula are there to support you during birth. When they step behind the camera, they move from participant to witness and are no longer supporting you. A nurse is often busy and photography is not a high priority. Most births are in low light situations. Photographing without the proper equipment and experience can result in blurry, grainy, and badly framed images. This is one of the most emotional and momentous experiences in your life. Most people who make this choice regret not having a professional photographer.</p>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>Do you use flash photography during birth?</h2>

        <p>I shoot with natural and available light. Flash photography can be disruptive and intrusive, especially in the dark, quiet space that is most birthing rooms.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>How many images can I expect?</h2>

        <p>Every birth is unique and the amount of images will depend on the individual circumstances. There may be less if your birth is very quick, very dark, or you can not tolerate my presence in the birth room. That being said, you can expect anywhere from 75 - 200 edited images, and often more.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>Do you edit every image?</h2>

        <p>I will provide you with a CD of images. Every image will be edited.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>Do you shoot in color or black and white?</h2>

        <p>I shoot in color. I may change an image to black and white during the editing process, however, I will provide a copy of that image in color.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>When should we call you?</h2>

        <p>This is something we will discuss at your prenatal meeting and may depend in part on your preferences. In general, I ask that you call me when you first go into labor, and then when you reach 3 cm, at which time I will make my way to the birth location. I provide calling cards to my birthing mamas that cover when and where to call.</p>
        <br>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>What if my birth is really, really long?</h2>

        <p>Birth is unpredictable. If the situation demands it I may need to take breaks, go for a walk, or even sleep, but I am always committed until the very end.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>What if I require a Cesarean birth?</h2>

        <p>Every birth is unique. If you require an unplanned Cesarean birth, I will advocate for myself to be in the operating room. In this situation, your (or your partner's) advocacy is very helpful. If for some reason I am not allowed for the procedure, there are plenty of photo opportunities before and after. I can also follow the baby and capture all those precious first moments while mom is in recovery.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>What if I schedule a Cesarean birth?</h2>

        <p>I am happy to photograph your planned Cesarean birth. It is often easier to get permission in advance to photograph in the operating room. It is not where and how you give birth that makes it special, it is the miracle of life and the powerful emotional connections that baby and birth create.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>What if you get sick or otherwise can't make it to my birth?</h2>

        <p>In the extremely unlikely event that I am unable to photograph your birth, your fee would be refunded minus my retainer.</p>

        <p>If I am unable to photograph your birth due to no fault of my own (ie: I was not given proper advance notice, the birth was very quick, or the hospital refused me admittance, etc.) your birth fee is non-refundable. Instead, I will photograph you and your baby during the first two days after birth.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>Are you going to post my pictures on the Internet?</h2>

        <p>Only discrete images are shared, with permission, on Facebook and on the blog. Beautiful birth images are often what inspire my clients to contact me so I encourage all clients to share what they are comfortable with so others can be equally inspired by your journey!</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>What if you miss the birth?</h2>

        <p>It is possible. I do promise to make every arrangement possible so that I am available for you. However, I do have a career that is unpredictable at times, but also very flexible. Having said that, if for some reason I am unable to attend your birth, I will make every effort to attend the location of birth to complete a "Just Born" session ** Free of Charge ** and you will also be granted a full refund.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>Do you offer discounts or take payments?</h2>

        <p>I do accept payments, however, no images will be provided to you until full payment is received.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <!-- new question -->
        <h2>How long will it take to get my photographs?</h2>

        <p>I will provide "sneak peeks" to you as soon as possible. These photos are also posted on my Facebook page (with your permission). This usually happens within 24 hours, you will receive 2 to 3 images sent to you via email within 48 hours.</p>

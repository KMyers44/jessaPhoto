        <h2>The Birth Story of Cruz Cameron</h2>

        <p>I enjoyed the last months of my pregnancy. I enjoyed the shape of them. The rounding of my belly as it expanded; the feeling of a small body moving within me; a sense of love and connection.</p>

        <p>In spanish, to give birth is "dar a la luz", to give to the light. While I was content to hold my baby wrapped in the snug darkness of my body, he was ready for the light.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it was in part the excitement and adrenaline rush of the night before, when instead of a quiet, relaxing evening, Brian and I were up late bandaging Coral's head after a fall. As the sun rose the next morning I lay quietly in bed with Brian, our hands on my belly, feeling the rising waves of contractions.</p>

        <p>Our baby was coming.</p>

        <p>We weren't quite ready. While I enjoyed a leisurely breakfast, cherishing those moments poised between pregnancy and birth, Brian cleaned up, took care of Coral and with the help of Jasmine, our midwife, prepared the house for our baby's arrival. While I sat in the rocking chair, reading between contractions, Brian tried to set up the birth tub.</p>

        <p>I had no sense of urgency. Coral's birth had taken 42 hours from the first contractions, this birth would only take 9. But I was blissfully unaware. The contractions strengthened steadily; never more than 7 minutes apart to begin with they quickly became 5 minutes apart.</p>

        <p>By the time my parents and Monica arrived about noon, I had given up on reading. I had given up on doing anything but riding the rise and fall of sensation with my breath.</p>

        <p>Brian was my support. He held me in the shower until the hot water was exhausted. He sat behind me on the deck, hands pressed to my lower back. We leaned against the wall in the birthing room; my arms pressed against his thighs, his knees bent to support our weight. And Coral was there, offering encouragement, "You can do it Mommy!"" and rubbing my back. And even getting bored, "Mommy, when youâ€™re done having the baby, can I do my paints?"</p>

        <p>I was surrounded by loving faces and encouraged by gentle hands, everyone eager to meet the new baby.</p>

        <p>And then I moved out of the 'Feeling' part of birth into the 'Instinctual' part of birth. The only thought I remember having is, "I want to rest! I need a break!"" and my own inner voice answering back, "You can rest after you get this baby out. So push this baby out!"</p>

        <p>Jasmine says my contractions were 1 minute apart, but to me they felt like one continuous wave of sensation. Even as one ended and I began to relax, I would feel the next one rising up and washing over me. And now I was ready. Ready to release my baby into the light.</p>

        <p>The midwives moved me into the bathroom. Such a tiny space! I stood over the toilet with Jasmine and Monica crouched at my feet. Brian looked in the doorway from the shower and Mama Suki looked in the doorway from the birthing room and I pushed. Pressing down with my body and my will, I pushed my baby out into the light and into the hands that waited to catch him.</p>

        <p>He had arrived, Cruz Cameron Buchalter, my precious little boy, at 3:20 pm on January 22nd, weighing 7 lbs, 10 oz. Everything was as it should be.</p>

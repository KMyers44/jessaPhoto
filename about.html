          <p>Welcome! I am Jessa Buchalter, I am a photographer and I am a yoga teacher, but first and foremost I am a woman and a mother passionate about birth. The first births I ever attended were those of my younger brother and sister at our home in St John, USVI. I was fortunate to grow up with coming-of-age flower ceremonies, sweat lodges and new moon drum circles. My mother is an "unofficial" childbirth educator and midwife assistant, I was brought up knowing that birth is beautiful and every birth story is worth documenting, telling and sharing.</p>

          <p>My love of photography blossomed in my high school darkroom. In college, I quickly jumped from early childhood education to art photography to photojournalism, graduating with a BS in Photojournalism from Syracuse Universityâ€™s Newhouse School of Communications. After college I freelanced for newspapers and photographed weddings and portraits, but I never felt I found my niche.</p>

          <p>My first pregnancy and birth was a transformational time for me. Birth was my true journey into womanhood. My daughter is also my teacher, constantly challenging me to be better and live more fully in the now. I have spent the last 6 years home with my 2 children on this physically grueling, spiritual journey that is Motherhood.</p>

          <p>I began teaching prenatal yoga after my daughter was born. My experience of empowerment during my pregnancy inspired me to try and share the powerful tools yoga provides for self discovery and empowerment with other new Mamas. My dream is to have all my birth photography clients practice yoga with me throughout their pregnancy so we can truly get to know each other and go on this journey together.</p>

          <p>Today I live with my family in Longmont, Colorado. I have finally found my niche! I love telling stories through photographs and I am honored by every opportunity to share a woman's birth journey. It is very exciting for me to finally meld my passions for photography, yoga and birth in a way that serves women and families.</p>

          <p>Birth is a personal and transformational process. It can be scary and intense, but it is always beautiful. My goal is to provide my clients and their family with a respectful and professional service, that will result in a beautiful collection of images they can treasure for years to come.</p>
